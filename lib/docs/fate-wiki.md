## Condensed / Core / Accelerated

<p class="author">By RPDeshaies</p>

The Fate System comes in different colors and it might be hard at first to understand which version to pick and start using. Let's try to demystify all of that.

- Fate Core is the fourth edition of the system and came out of a [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/evilhat/fate-core) in 2016.
- Fate Accelerated _is_ Fate Core but with different dials. Some concepts have been simplified to make it easier to grab the book and start playing as fast as possible.
- Fate Condensed is the latest iteration of Fate. Fate v4.5 if you will. It came out in early 2020 and contains all the rules you need to play Fate in a very brief but comprehensive way.

If you still don't know where to start, here's a tip:

- [Read Fate Condensed](/srds/condensed) for a quick overview of the most up to date rules.
- [Read Fate Core](/srds/core) for all its great examples and guides on how to play.
- [Read Fate Accelerated](/srds/accelerated) if you want a more simplified version of the system and want to get started quickly.

## What's the Math Behind The Fate Dice

<p class="author">By RPDeshaies</p>

The big thing we need to understand when using Fudge/Fate Dice is that the chances of getting a `+4/-4` versus getting a `0` are very different.

Outlining the results in a graph where the **vertical axis represents the chances of getting a result** and where the **horizontal axis lists all the possible results**, you would get something that looks like this:

```

  23.46% |     ___
         |    /   \
         |   /     \
         |  /       \
         | /         \
  1.23%  --------------
         -4     0     +4
```

So you technically have a 1.23% (1/81) chance of getting a `-4/+4` but a 23.46% chance of getting a `0`.

Where it gets crazy is when you start thinking _about the chances of getting a `0` or higher?_.

Because the probabilities are going to stack, you get 61.73% chances to get a `0` or higher.

If you were playing with a D20, the graph would look something like this:

```
   |
   |
   |
   |
5% | -------------
   |
   |
   ---------------
   0 1 2 [...]  20

```

That flat line means that basically, you have equal chances of getting each result severalty which, by consequence means that the outcome of a roll tend to also be "flatter".

Since Fudge/Fate Dice statistics have this bell curve quality to them, the results will have a big tendency to stay in the `-1 ==> 1` range.

All of that said, getting `+4` or a `-4` with those dice truly feels like something unique.

| Result | Odd of rolling | Odd of rolling this or higher |
| ------ | -------------- | ----------------------------- |
| -4     | 1.23%          | 100%                          |
| -3     | 4.94%          | 98.77%                        |
| -2     | 12.35%         | 93.83%                        |
| -1     | 19.75%         | 81.48%                        |
| 0      | 23.46%         | 61.73%                        |
| 1      | 19.75%         | 38.27%                        |
| 2      | 12.35%         | 18.52%                        |
| 3      | 4.94%          | 6.17%                         |
| 4      | 1.23%          | 1.23%                         |

## How to GM Fate

<p class="author">By Dgerrimea</p>

<p class="with-anchor">The Fate Mentality</p>

- Take inspiration from movies and TV, not from video games.
- In D&D you start with what's true about the world, and cool moments come out of following the realistic (in that world) consequences of PC actions.
- Fate is the other way around; you begin with the cool moments you want to create, and you then establish whatever facts about the world you need to get you there.

<p class="with-anchor">Prepping Fate</p>

- You need a story problem which is urgent, and catastrophic if ignored.
- Look at the PCs' aspects, and the game aspects, and see what problems those imply.
- Make them open-ended, like "aliens are attacking".
- Then think about what details you need to solve the problem, like "how many aliens, who's the leader, how are they invading, where and when?"
- Answering each of those questions is a problem in its own right, and each scene should answer one or two of these questions.
- Think of who would oppose the PCs, and prepare them and their minions.

<p class="with-anchor">Running Fate</p>

- Think in terms of scenes, and montage anything that doesn't deserve to be a scene.
- Each scene needs a story question to answer (that's how you know when the scene is over), and a source of opposition (that's how you give your problem agency and urgency).
  â€‹

<p class="with-anchor">Misc Tips</p>

- Don't roll unless success and failure are both interesting
- Don't set up enemies just to be knocked down; PC's are damn resilient and failure is fun anyway
- Don't forget how much narrative agency the players have. If they spend a fate point and say there's a secret door, then there's a secret door now. Forget about maps and plot twists; you're not showing your players something you made earlier, you're making it with them as a team. Don't take that away from them!
