## FAQ

> ### Where is my data stored ?
>
> All your data is saved locally on your computer / phone.
> Fari doesn't use any cloud databases but we do use Google Analytis.
>
> Your data can also be shared with others using peer to peer connections but that feature is entirely optional and only happens when you click "Start Game Session" from a scene and share your game session link with someone.
>
> The peer to peer connection is closed if you close your browser's tab
>
> ### Is there a mobile app ? Android ? iOS ?
>
> Yes and no. Fari is a Progressive Web Application, which means you can install it on your computer (Chrome) and with Android. It's also 100% built with mobile in mind. Sadly, iOS doesn't support Progressive Web Applications, but maybe in the future they will. You can click on the menu on the top left corner of the app to install Fari on your device.
