There are a lot of new things to talk about, so I'll get started right away.

## üì∞ Documents

[Fari](https://fari.app), The Fate RPG Companion App, now contains tons of very helpful resources.

Thanks to /u/wizardoest, I was able to add the SRDs content accessible directly within the app. You can now easily read the documentation for Fate Condensed, Core, Accelerated as well as the System and Adversaries Toolkit inside Fari.

Check it out here: [https://fari.app/srds](https://fari.app/srds).

Thanks to Evil Hat, I was able to add a page which contains tons of great Stunt Examples which was previously available on Evil Hat's wiki.

Find your next awesome stunt here: [https://fari.app/fate-stunts](https://fari.app/fate-stunts).

Reddit users /u/Laurence_M and /u/famousbirds were kind enough to let me include their helpful "Scene Checklist" and "Cheat Sheet" documents inside Fari as well. Thank you so much to you both.

Check out those awesome documents here:

## üåü Features

I was also able to work on adding two new features to the app:

- It is now possible for a GM to have private and public index cards. That way, GMs can prepare their scenes in advance and pull in the cards as they play. Pretty helpful for a nice BBEG reveal!
- I added a private "Notes" section for scene. With this field, GMs will be able to add information that will help them run their scenes better and not forget about certain things they wanted to do!

## üì¢ Discord

Lastly, Fari now has a Discord server.
