# Fari v3.3.0 - The one with groups, skill rolls and Patreon

Hey guys!

First of all, I've launched a new [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/fariapp) page for Fari.

If you want to support Fari on a monthly basis, well now you can do it for the price of a coffee.

Also, I just released version 3.3.0 [of Fari](http://fari.app/) 🚀

This version includes:

- The ability to group scenes or character sheets together (e.g. by campaigns)
- The ability to roll the dice with a modifier by clicking on a character sheet skill label
- Support for wider resolutions
- A brand new "Notes" field in the character sheet [#145](https://github.com/fariapp/fari/issues/145) 👏 [tgirod](https://github.com/tgirod)
- Russian Localizations [#122](https://github.com/fariapp/fari/issues/122) 👏 [hattivatt](https://github.com/hattivatt)
- Various bug fixes and minor improvements like loosing context when opening the draw area in full screen or character syncronisation during gameplay.

If you have any questions or want to talk about Fari, you can [start a discussion](https://github.com/fariapp/fari/discussions) on Github. If you encounter any issues with the release, don't hesitate to create a new [bug report](https://github.com/fariapp/fari/issues/new/choose).

As always, feedback is more than welcome and if you can, [please consider donating](https://ko-fi.com/rpdeshaies) or [become a patron](https://www.patreon.com/fariapp) to support Fari's development.
