# New Fari Release v3.3.5 | The One With the Oracle, a New User interfaces and Performance Enhancements.

First I want to thank my patrons for helping to make this update possible.

Now, let's talk about what's new!

So I've released a new version of [Fari](http://fari.app/) which includes:

- The Oracle, a way for you to ask questions based on the likeliness of it being true and get a random answer! This is perfect for luck based questions or for playing Fate without a GM.
- A branding update with new colors, a new logo and an updated home page.
- Performance enhancements. I made a lot of small enhancements that should make Fari way faster than it was before.

Some bugs were also squashed. Things like:

- fix: #160 encoding issues when transferring player names with emojis like üê∫
- fix: #163 drawing area not updating for players when moving objects
- fix: #119 more robust character sync during sessions
