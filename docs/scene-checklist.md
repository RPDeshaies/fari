<page-meta author="Laurence Macnaughton" description="The ultimate checklist to go through to make sure your scene help move your story forward."></page-meta>

If you feel stumped or overwhelmed during a scene, quickly go down this list and ask the players a few of those questions.

> ## The Checklist
>
> - What are you trying to achieve here, and why? (PC goal)
> - What does success look like for you? (Success result)
> - What’s at risk if this goes badly? (Failure result)
> - Where are we? Describe it. Interior/exterior, day/night? What do we see, hear, feel, smell/taste?
> - What's dangerous or interesting here? What impedes movement or sight? What can the PCs use? (Situation aspects) Any free invokes?
> - Do we need a map? (2-4 zones)
> - Who else is here? (NPCs) What do they want? What are they doing?
> - Who or what stands between you and your goal? (NPC and/or Obstacle)
> - How will you achieve your goal?
>   - "I'll try to Take Them Out." = Conflict
>   - "I'll try to ** before they **." = Contest
>   - "I'll try to \_\_ this situation." = Challenge

## Tips

- Ask them what they want. Put trouble in the way.
- End the scene on a disaster, cliffhanger, twist, or intriguing clue: "Now you need to go to [PLACE] in order to [GOAL] or else things will get even worse."
- If you're stumped about the game world, ask the players.
- For inspiration, look at their character sheets. Everything the player put on it is something they want to be part of the game.
- If the story isn't moving forward, add danger. Give them an immediate threat to react to.
