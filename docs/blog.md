# Fate Moves<page-meta author="RPDeshaies" date="2021-02-05">

A Powered by the Apocalypse inspired mechanic for the Fate role-playing game.

## Context

In Fate, characters can do anything, but in terms of rules, there are only 4 actions a character can do. They can **Attack** someone or something, **Defend** themselves, **Create an Advantage** or **Overcome** an obstacle.

Lets compare this quickly to the Powered By The Apocalypse System where the players have a set of **Moves**. Those moves are basically actions that a character can do and each **Move** has a game mechanic attached to it.

For example, in Monster of the Week you have: `Kick Some Ass`, `Act Under Pressure`, `Help Out`, `Investigate a Mystery`, `Manipulate Someone`, `Protect Someone`, `Read a Bad Situation` and `Use Magic`.

In PBTA games, **Moves** vehicle something that Fate Actions have a hard time doing: they clearly layout multiple examples of how the rules can be bend to match what a player wants.

I feel like **Moves** have a big downside to them. Since there is no general underlying mechanic for them, it is harder to know what to do when a player character does something that doesn't match any premade **Move**.

Fate Actions on the contrary shine in this situation since they are generic on purpose, in part because Fate's Golden Rule:

> _Decide what you’re trying to accomplish first, then consult the rules to help you do it._
>
> \- [Running the Game | Fate Core](https://fari.app/srds/core/running-the-game?goTo=the-golden-rule)

That being said, I feel like Actions have a couple of issues.

Firstly, they make it harder for new or _temporarily indecisive_ players to know what they can do during a session.

Secondly, because they are very broad and generic, you need to stretch the original definition of the words to make them match certain situations. (e.g. You can use the **Defend** action to oppose someone else's **Create An Advantage** action.)

While it's all fun to have very generic terms that give us and our characters the ability to do anything, imposing restrictions or _initial_ guidelines can actually boost creativity.

Which is why I want to try to create a generic list of moves for the Fate System using it's Actions at the core of each move.

## The Moves

Those are some examples that I think outline most action types but you can definitely come up with your own or more setting specific moves for your games.

Enjoy!

### Harm Someone

Use `Attack` <fate>A</fate> and <fate>+</fate> `Fight / Shoot / Provoke` to deal damage to another character.

### Brace Yourself

Use `Defend` <fate>D</fate> and <fate>+</fate> `Athletics / Fight` to protect yourself from immediate danger.

### Protect Someone from Danger

Use `Defend` <fate>D</fate> and <fate>+</fate> `Athletics / Fight` to place yourself between immediate danger and someone in order to try to protect them.

When doing this you expose yourself to possibly suffering the effects of any failed rolls.

### Stop Someone

Use `Defend` <fate>D</fate> to oppose someone from trying to `Create an Advantage` against you.

### Act Under Pressure

Use `Overcome` <fate>O</fate> to see if you can succeed the challenge.

### Provide Support

Figure out who has the highest level in the skill among the participants. Each other participant who has at least Average (+1) in that skill adds a +1 to the highest person’s skill level. Supporters face the same costs and consequences as the person making the roll.

### Investigate a Situation

Use `Create an Advantage` <fate>C</fate> and <fate>+</fate> `Investigate` to try to find something to help move the story forward.

### Find Something Useful

Use `Create an Advantage` <fate>C</fate> and <fate>+</fate> `Notice` to try to find something you can use to your advantage.

### Manipulate Someone

Use `Create an Advantage` <fate>C</fate> and <fate>+</fate> `Deceive / Rapport` to convince someone to do what you tell them to do.

>
> ### Overcome
>
> - **If you fail,** discuss with the GM (and the defending player, if any) whether it’s a failure or success at a major cost.
> - **If you tie,** it’s success at a minor cost—you’re in a tough spot, the enemy gets a boost, or you may take a hit. Alternatively, you fail but gain a boost.
> - **If you succeed,** you meet your goal and the story moves on without hiccups.
> - **If you succeed with style,** it’s a success and you also get a boost.
>
> ### Create An Advantage
>
> Your outcomes when creating a new aspect are:
>
> - **If you fail,** you either don’t create the aspect (failure) or you create it but the enemy gets the free invoke (success at a cost). If you succeed at a cost, the final aspect may need to be rewritten to benefit the enemy. This may still be worth it because aspects are true.
> - **If you tie,** you don’t create an aspect, but you do get a boost.
> - **If you succeed,** you create a situation aspect with one free invoke on it.
> - **If you succeed with style,** you create a situation aspect with _two_ free invokes on it.
>
> With an existing known or unknown aspect the outcomes are:
>
> - **If you fail,** and the aspect was known, the enemy gets a free invoke. If it was unknown, they may choose to reveal it to get a free invoke.
> - **If you tie,** you gain a boost if the aspect was unknown; it stays unknown. If the aspect is known, you get a free invoke on it instead.
> - **If you succeed,** gain a free invoke on the aspect, revealing it if unknown.
> - **If you succeed with style,** gain two free invokes, revealing it if unknown.
>
> ### Attack
>
> - **If you fail,** you fail to connect—the attack is parried, dodged, or maybe just absorbed by armor.
> - **If you tie,** maybe you barely connect, maybe you cause the defender to flinch. Either way, you get a boost.
> - **If you succeed,** you deal a hit equal to the difference between your attack’s total and the defense’s effort. The defender must absorb this hit with stress or consequences, or else be taken out.
> - **If you succeed with style,** you deal a hit just like a success, but you may reduce the shifts of the hit by one to get a boost.
>
> ### Overcome
>
> - **If you fail** against an attack, you take a hit, which you must absorb with stress or consequences. Regardless, the enemy succeeds as described for their action.
> - **If you tie,** proceed according to the tie result for the opposed action.
> - **If you succeed,** you don’t take a hit or you deny the enemy’s action.
> - **If you succeed with style,** you don’t take a hit, you deny the enemy’s action, and you even get a boost as you gain the upper hand for a moment.
