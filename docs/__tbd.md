## Any old port in a storm

The PCs are seeking shelter from the elements or some other threat, and come across a place to hole up. They find that they have stumbled across something dangerous, secret, or supernatural, and must then deal with it in order to enjoy a little rest.

## Better late than ever

Some bad guys have arrived and done some bad guy things. The PCs were none the wiser. The bad guys have now made good their escape, and the PCs have caught wind of it in time to chase them down before they make it back to their lair, their home nation, behind enemy lines, etc.

## Blackmail

Usually through trickery (but some- times by digging into the PCs’ past), an antagonist has something to hold over the heads of the PCs and make them jump. This could be any kind of threat from physical to social, but it depends on the villain having some- thing - even if it’s information - that others don’t have. Now, he is pulling the strings of the PCs, telling them to do things they don’t want to. The PCs must end the cycle of blackmail, deprive the villain of his edge, and keep him temporarily satisfied while doing it.

## Breaking and entering

Mission objective: enter the danger- ous place, and retrieve the vital din- gus or valuable person. Overcome the area’s defenses to do so.

## Capture the Flag

The PCs must secure a military target for the good guys. There are bad guys there that prefer not to be secured. The fundamental tactical scenario.

## Clearing the Hex

There is a place where bad things live. The PCs must make it safe for nice people, systematically clearing it of danger.

## Delver's Delight

The PCs are treasure-hunters, who have caught wind of a treasure-laden ruin. They go to explore it, and must deal with its supernatural denizens to win the treasure and get out alive.

## Don't Eat the Purple Ones

The PCs are stranded in a strange place, and must survive by finding food and shelter, and then worry about getting back home.

## Elementary, my Dear Watson

A crime or atrocity has been commit- ted; the PCs must solve it. They must interview witnesses (and prevent them from being killed), gather clues (and prevent them from being stolen or ruined). They must then assemble proof to deliver to the authorities, or serve as personal ministers of justice.

## Escort Service

The PCs have a valuable object or person, which needs to be taken to a safe place or to its rightful owner, etc. They must undertake a dangerous journey in which one or more factions (and chance and misfortune) try to deprive them of the thing in their care.

## Good Housekeeping

The PCs are placed in charge of a large operation (a trading company, a feudal barony, the CIA) and must, despite lack of experience in such things, make it work and thrive.

## Help is on the way

A person (church group, nation, galaxy) is in a hazardous situation they can’t survive without rescue. The PCs are on the job. In some scenarios, the hook is as simple as a distant yell or crackly distress signal.

## Hidden Base

The PCs, while traveling or exploring, come across a hornet’s nest of bad guys, preparing for Big Badness. They must either find some way to get word to the good guys, or sneak in and disable the place themselves, or a combination of both.

## How much for just the dingus

Within a defined area, something important and valuable exists. The PCs (or their employers) want it, but so do one or more other groups. The ones that get it will be the ones that can outthink and outrace the others,deal best with the natives of the area, and learn the most about their target.Each competing group has its own agenda and resources.

## Beg your pardon ?

The PCs are minding their own busi- ness when they are attacked or threatened. They don’t know why. They must solve the mystery of their attacker’s motives, and in the mean- time fend off more attacks. They must put two and two together to deal with the problem.

## Long of short fork when dining on elf ?

The PCs are a diplomatic vanguard, trying to open up (or shore up) either political or trade relations with a strange culture. All they have to do is manage for a day or so among the strange customs without offending anybody . . . and what information they have is both incomplete and dangerously misleading.

## Look, don't touch

The PCs are working surveillance - spying on a person, gathering infor- mation on a beast in the wild, scout- ing a new sector. Regardless of the scale, the primary conflict (at least at the start) is the rule that they are only to watch, listen and learn. They are not to make contact or let them- selves be known.

## Manhunt

Someone is gone: they've run away, gotten lost, or simply haven't called home in a while. Somebody misses them or needs them returned. The PCs are called in to find them and bring them back.

## Missing Memories

One or more of the PCs wakes up with no memory of the recent past, and now they find themselves in some kind of trouble they don’t understand. The PCs must find the reason for the memory lapse, and solve any problems they uncover in the meantime.

## Most peculiar, momma

Something both bad and inexplicable is happening (racial tension is being fired up in town, all the power is out, the beer supply is drained, it’s snowing in July, Voyager still has fans, hordes of aliens are eating all the cheese), and a lot of people are very troubled by it. The PCs must track the phenomenon to its source, and stop it.

## No one has soiled the bridge

The PCs are assigned to guard a sin- gle vital spot (anything from a mountain pass to a solar system) from impending or possible attack. They must plan their defensive strat- egy, set up watches, set traps, and so on, and then deal with the enemy when it arrives.

## Not in Kansas

The PCs are minding their own busi- ness and find themselves transported to a strange place. They must figure out where they are, why they are there and how to escape.

## Ounces of prevention

A villain or organization is getting ready to do something bad, and the PCs have received a tip-off of some sort. They must investigate to find out more about the caper, and then act to prevent it.

## Pandora's Box

Somebody has tinkered with Things Man Ought Not, or opened a portal to the Mean People Dimension, cracked a wall at the state prison, or sum- moned an ancient Babylonian god into a penthouse. Before the PCs can even think of confronting the source of the trouble, they must deal with the waves of trouble already released by it: monsters, old foes out for vengeance, curious aliens who think cars/citizens/McDonald’s hamburgers resemble food, and so forth.

## Quest for the Sparkly Hoozits

Somebody needs a dingus (to fulfill a prophecy, heal the monarch, prevent a war, cure a disease, or what have you). The PCs must find a dingus. Often an old dingus, a mysterious dingus, and a powerful dingus. The PCs must learn more about it to track it down, and then deal with taking it from wherever it is.

## Recent Ruins

A town, castle, starship, outpost, or other civilized construct is lying in ruins. Very recently, it was just dandy. The PCs must enter the ruins, explore them, and find out what happened.

## Running the Gauntlet

The PCs must travel through a haz- ardous area, and get through without being killed, robbed, humiliated, debased, diseased, or educated by whatever is there. The troubles they encounter are rarely personal in nature - the place itself is the “vil- lain” of the adventure.

## Safari

The PCs are on a hunting expedition, to capture or kill and elusive and prized creature. They must deal with its envi- ronment, its own ability to evade them, and possibly its ability to fight them.

## Score one for the home team

The PCs are participants in a race, contest, tournament, scavenger hunt or other voluntary bit of sport. They must win.

## Stalag 23

The PCs are imprisoned, and must engineer an escape, overcoming any guards, automatic measures, and geo- graphic isolation their prison imposes on them.

## Take us to Memphis and don't slow down

The PCs are on board a populated conveyance (East Indiaman, Cruise Ship, Ferry, Sleeper Starship), when it is hijacked. The PCs must take action while the normals sit and twiddle.

## Troublemakers

A bad guy (or a group of them, or multiple parties) is kicking up a ruckus, upsetting the neighbors, poisoning the reservoirs, or otherwise causing trouble. The PCs have to go where the trouble is, locate the bad guys, and stop the party.

## Uncharted waters

The PCs are explorers, and their goal is to enter an unknown territory and scope it out. Naturally, the job isn’t just going to be surveying and draw- ing sketches of local fauna; some- thing is there, something fascinating and threatening.

## We're on the outside looking in

Any of the basic plots in this list can be reengineered with the PCs on the outside of it. Either the PCs are accompanying other characters in the midst of such a plot (often being called on to defend the plot from the outside, as it were), or they are minding their own business when the others involved in the plot show up, and must pick sides or simply resist. For instance, with Any Old Port In The Storm, the PCs could already be enjoying (or native to) the shelter when a strange group arrives. If the “the PCs are unwelcome” variant is employed, then perhaps the PCs will
