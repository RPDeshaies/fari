## Fari's Mission

> Provide an optimized, simple and custom tailored user experience to play the [Fate](https://www.evilhat.com/home/fate-core/) generic role-playing game system online.

That being said, it doesn't mean that we will build all the features requested in the issue's section of the project.

Each feature suggestion will be evaluated on the technical and on the user experience perspective before being "Approved" for developement to make sure it is:

1. Feasible
2. Matches the mission of the project
3. Works for the greater community.

## Your First Contribution

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this _free_ series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

## Submitting code

Any code change should be submitted as a pull request. The description should explain what the code does and give steps to execute it. The pull request should also contain tests.

## Code review process

The bigger the pull request, the longer it will take to review and merge. Try to break down large pull requests in smaller chunks that are easier to review and merge.
It is also always helpful to have some context for your pull request. What was the purpose? Why does it matter to you?

## Questions

If you have any questions, create an [issue](issue) (protip: do a quick search first to see if someone else didn't ask the same question before!).
